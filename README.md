## Discontinued
Due to limited access to historical headline data, creating an accurately trained model using information pre Covid recession is impossible. The current model has a 65% accuracy rate at knowing which way the market would go the following day, but does not have enough data for the outcome to be related.

## Intro
This is meant to regularly scrape data online, label it based off of stock movement during the day and the associated stock to the article and train a model. Model can be used to determine stock price movement.

## To Do List
- [x] Automate stock price collection from Yahoo  (07.06.2020)
- [x] Increase resolution from reading the market and labeling the articles
- [ ] Improve bad coding practices such as lack of class function flexibility
- [ ] Create a class for model testing
- [ ] Create a file that constantly runs to convert static data into a proper datastream
- [ ] UI?
